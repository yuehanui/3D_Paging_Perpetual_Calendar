# 3D_Paging_Perpetual_Calendar
###A Perpetual Calendar built using JavaScript with 3D paging effect.

This project is written using HTML and JavaScript. It currently support "next day" and "previous day" browsing. I plan to add year and month browsing mode into it.

To use it, download the calendar.htm file and drag it to your browser.
